-- To make git directory in VS Code:
git init
git add .
git commit -m"new commit"
git branch -M main (to rename a existing current branch)
git remote add origin repo_link
git push -u origin main

-- git status to track down files.

-- when there are empty folders, not even files, then git status even after creating new folders will say nothing to push. But for tracking changes, add .gitkeep in that type of folders and this file is empty.

-- file creation flow:

1.package.json through npm init and add script and type
add nodemon by installing npm i -D nodemon --> a dev dependency which does not go into production unlike main dependency.
and add script: "dev" : "nodemon src/index.js"

2.Readme.md
.gitkeep
.gitignore (copy all node files from .gitignore generator)
.env (environment variable file)

3.make a src folder in main directory, and in src folder create:
  app.js
  constants.js 
  index.js

4. In src folder, make directories:
  controllers: main functionality is here
  db: database connection
  models: schemas
  middlewars: to impose checkin between frontend and servers
  utils: utilitiess like mail utility, file upload, etc.
  routes: various routes

5. download prettier extension: npm i -D prettier
then create a file .prettierrc and then add the following:

{
    "singleQuote": false,
    "bracketSpacing": true,
    "tabWidth": 2,
    "trailingComma": "es5",
    "semi": true
}

make .prettierignore so that those files can't be affected and the following:

/.vscode
/node_modules
./dist

*.env
.env
.env.*
